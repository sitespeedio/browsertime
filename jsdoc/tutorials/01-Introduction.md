Scripting in sitespeed.io and Browsertime allows you to measure user journeys by interacting with web pages. This feature is essential for simulating real-user interactions and collecting performance metrics for complex workflows. It's important to note that scripting works the same in both Browsertime and sitespeed.io.

In sitespeed.io 27.0 and later, the project transitioned to a pure ESM (ECMAScript Module) package, which means you can choose between ESM and CommonJS formats for your scripting files. Examples in this tutorial use ESM format.
