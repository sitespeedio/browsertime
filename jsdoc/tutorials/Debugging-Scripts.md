Debugging is crucial for script development. Here are some tips:

- Use `--debug` mode to add breakpoints.
- Utilize `context.log` for logging within your script.
- Run scripts locally for easier debugging.
- In Docker environments, use `--browsertime.videoParams.debug` to record a full video of your script for analysis.
- Implement `try/catch` blocks and `await` promises for robust error handling.
