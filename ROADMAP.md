# Roadmap

The roadmap is a tentative plan for the core development team. Things change constantly as pull requests come in and priorities change, but it will give you an idea of our current vision and plan. 
  
The roadmap for the rest of 2020 is to refactor and clean up the code since we the last year added a lot of functionality. The start for that work is to cleanup the browser delegate structure as in [#1322](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/1322).
