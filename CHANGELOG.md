# Browsertime changelog

## 3.4.1 - 2018-09-13
### Fixed
* Tech: We unified how we change the background color from orange to white when we record the video (to be able to know when the navigation start) [PR 634](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/634).

## 3.4.0 - 2018-09-13
### Added 
* Upgraded to Chromedriver 2.41.0.
* Upgraded to Chrome 69 and Firefox 62 in the Docker container.

### Fixed
* There been several [reports on bugs](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1949) when using a preScript to login and then measure a page. The problem has been how we find the first frame + a bug that didn't make the video with orange frames between different pages. Thats been fixed now in [#633](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/633).

## 3.3.1 - 2018-08-09
### Fixed
* Tech: Browsertime now logs under the browsertime name and we unified the log format to be the same as sitespeed.io. Add --verbose to log by name (useful for running Browsertime in sitespeed.io) and log the pageComplete check JavaScript only in debug mode (instead of verbose).

## 3.3.0 - 2018-07-29
### Added
* Updated to Chrome 68 in the Docker container.

### Fixed
* Added extra check for not use full time out if you navigate to the same URL [#625](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/625).

## 3.2.3 - 2018-07-20
### Fixed
* Increase timeout to wait for page navigation. Before it was 5s, now it is 50s [#623](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/623).

## 3.2.2 - 2018-07-20
### Fixed
* If you configured to not keep the video, there was a miss-match when removing the video (we also tried to remove the screenshot dir), so you got an error in the log. That is fixed by [#621](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/621).

## 3.2.1 - 2018-07-14
### Fixed
* Handle . (dot) in userTiming names [#618](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/618).
* You can now add multiple cookies by adding --cookie multiple times [#619](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/619).
* Updated the [Browsertime extension](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime-extension) to 0.13.0. The new version takes care of the difference on how Firefox and Chrome implements the API. In the old version, clearing the cache with --cacheClearRaw throwed an error. That is fixed now. 

## 3.2.0 - 2018-06-30
### Fixed
* The Browsertime-extension was broken in Firefox, probably since there was a change in extension handling in FF 55 and effecting us in FF 61.

### Added
* You can now easy add a cookie. At the moment we only support one cookie but let us fix that after the summer holiday ```--cookie name=value``` 

## 3.1.4 - 2018-06-25
### Fixed
* Upgraded to Geckodriver 0.21.0 https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.21.0
* The Docker container uses Firefox 61 stable.

## 3.1.3 - 2018-06-14
### Fixed
* You can now set the device serial if you run multiple devices to reverse the traffic when you run Android devices from Ubuntu. Set -e DEVICE_SERIAL=PHONE_ID. If you run this before, the reverse of tcp failed.
* We now clear the console log before testing (in Chrome) [#611](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/611).
* We fixed so that you can collect the netlog in Chrome even though you turn off getting the HAR [#612](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/612).

##  3.1.2 - 2018-06-12
### Fixed
* Upgraded Chromedriver to 2.40.0.
* Upgraded ADB in the Docker container work with Chromedriver > 2.39 fixing problems running on Docker Ubuntu driving Chrome on Android.
* Upgraded Firefox 61 to beta 13 (form beta 5) in Docker. 

## 3.1.1 - 2018-06-01
### Fixed
* Updated Chrome-HAR to 0.4.1 to be extra careful when we check for pushed responses.

## 3.1.0 - 2018-06-01
### Added
* Upgraded to Chromedriver 2.39
* Upgraded to Chrome 67

### Fixed
*  We reverted the change of using pageLoadStrategy *none* as default (we now use normal as we done since day 1). This means it is easier for users that uses pre/post script = you will get control when the page has finished loading instead of when navigation starts. You can still use the none option by adding ```--pageLoadStrategy none``` to your run (that is useful if you want to end your tests earlier).

## 3.0.16 - 2018-05-30
### Fixes
* Fixing setting ifb0 twice in Throttle.

## 3.0.15 - 2018-05-30
### Fixes
* Another go trying to fix Throttle in Docker for multiple URLs.

## 3.0.14 - 2018-05-30
### Fixes
* Upgraded Throttle to 0.4.0 to hopefully fix https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2063
* Upgrade to chrome-har 0.4.0, with a fix for including HTTP/2 assets in HARs.

## 3.0.13 - 2018-05-23
### Fixes
* The current official version of the HAR Export Trigger doesn't work on 60 (you need 61). Let us not run the plugin on 60 [#603](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/603).

## 3.0.12 - 2018-05-23
### Fixes
* Rollbacked the Firefox HAR export since the new version breaks support for FF 60 (I missed that) and the new HAR misses content fields.

## 3.0.11 - 2018-05-22
### Fixes
* In Docker with  Firefox we now don't choose the netmonitor devtools tab, hopefully making less CPU impact when we collect the HAR [#598](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/598).

## 3.0.10 - 2018-05-22
### Fixes
* npm ping issues making our packages not go out as they should, lets try it again. The problem is the npm registry https://github.com/npm/registry/issues/327


## 3.0.9 - 2018-05-22
### Fixes
* Another fix for making it possible to run on Android phones on SauceLabs: You can now use the Browsertime extension, for example --cacheClearRaw.

## 3.0.8 - 2018-05-21
### Fixed
* Using --android flag to disable setting the window size didn't work. You need to do that to run on real devices on SauceLabs. We don't recommend to do it, but we know people do that so we want to keep it working.

## 3.0.7 - 2018-05-18
### Fixed
* The original problem of https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2040 happens if we set an output dir and the mp4 file already exits when we tries to convert it. This fix removes the file if it exists before converting [#594](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/594).

## 3.0.6 - 2018-05-18
### Fixed
* Use the stdin ignore flag when converting video files using FFMPEG, hopefully fixing freezing converts reported in https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2040 [#592](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/592).

## 3.0.5 - 2018-05-17
### Fixed
* We upgraded our own build of the HAR Export trigger to use the official one [#589](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/589).
* More solid solution to wait in navigation to start [#590](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/590).
* Better logs to understand why convert the video sometimes fails/halts.

## 3.0.4 - 2018-05-16
### Fixed
* Updated Firefox 61b3 to Firefox 61b5
* Bugfix: Wait longer before Firefox has finished navigated see https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/2040 fixed with [#584](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/584).

## 3.0.3 - 2018-05-15
### Fixed
* Updated WebPageReplay with fix for "Improve replay determinism". Build 2018-05-14.
* Use -e to set which port to use for WebPageReplay in Docker. Use -e WPR_HTTP_PORT=X and -e WPR_HTTPS_PORT=Y
* Fixed broken license file for WPR.

## 3.0.2 - 2018-05-14
### Fixed
* Updated Docker dependencies so downloaded files are remove -> smaller Docker file. Thanks [@sodabrew](https://github.com/sodabrew) for the PRs.
* Another go at making WebPageReplay work with ADB (small fix)
* Browsertime + WebPageReplay returned an error code instead of 0 after a succesful run (Docker container only).

## 3.0.1 - 2018-05-12
### Fixed
* Removed chrome.loadTimes from RUMSpeedIndex to get rid of Chrome warnings.

## 3.0.0
We have worked a lot to make Browsertime 3.0 the best version so far. Read the [blog post](https://www.sitespeed.io/browsertime-3.0/) about the 3.0 release. And please read the [breaking changes](#breaking-change) before you update!

## Internal changes/developers
* We have removed the use of Bluebird Promises and now uses async/await and native Promises.
* In some cases we leaked Bluebird promises, this is changed to native promises.
* Running the engine took a promise that eventually became the scripts. Now you need to run with the scripts directly (no promises) to simplify the flow.

## Added

* We updated the browsers in the Docker container to Chrome 66 and latest Firefox 61 beta.
* You can now turn on the MOZ HTTP log for Firefox with ```--firefox.collectMozLog``` [#451](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/451) see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Debugging/HTTP_logging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Debugging/HTTP_logging)
* Upgraded to new Browsertime extension with [support for web sockets](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime-extension/issues/5).
* You can now choose niceness level for FFMPEG during a recording using ```--videoParams.nice```. With this you can finetune the prio for the FFMPEG process.
* In the browsertime.json you now get errors in the errors array. This makes it possible for us to gracefully handle if one of the runs fails.
* You can now gzip the HAR file by adding ```--gzipHar``` to your run.
* Option to end test on 5s of inactivity [#574](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/574). Do it by adding ```--pageCompleteCheckInactivity```.
* Updated [Throttle](https://github.com/sitespeedio/throttle) to 0.3.
* You can now add a resultURL to the video/screenshots in the HAR.
* The netlog is now gzipped from Chrome.
* You can now install your own extension: [#552](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/552).

## Fixed

* We now use the latest and greatest Visual Metrics [#542](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/542) and always get the viewport, hopefully fixing the problem with last visual change that sometimes happens for emulated mobile.
* Updated Chrome-HAR that fixes problems in Chrome 66.
* New version of the trace parser (for CPU metrics) with updated feature list.
* Move video out of pre/post scripts. When we first started with the video we used the pre/post structure. That was ok to move fast but one of the negatives is that stopping the video happen after we collected all metrics. We now stop the video exactly when the the page is finished loading [#448](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/448).
* In the browsretime.json mdev was never formatted, now we use 4 decimals (make the JSON more readable) [#453](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/453).
* Modernized the JavaScript we use to collect the metrics, see [#457](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/457).
* Fixed so that Chrome on Android can use the ExtensionServer (clear the cache, add request headers etc) [#470](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/470).
* Better handling of Chrome emulated mobile: We now set the correct window size for phones [#528](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/528)
* Errors is now an array of an array: one run can produce multiple errors.

### Changed

* Store the Chromedriver log in the result directory (before it was stored where you run Browsertime) [#452](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/452).
* Metrics like first paint, resource timings and paint timings was reported with 8 decimals in worst cases. Reporting in full ms is ok [#455](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/455).
* The video now ends on Last Visual Change + 1 s (before it could go on as long as the video was recorded).
* All Chrome trace files are now gzipped [#517](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/517)
* Firefox preferences now uses mostly the same settings as Mozilla do in their performance tests [#524](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/524).

### BREAKING CHANGE

* Store extra JSON and screenshots per run (and collect stats between runs). We want to make Browsertime as mean and clean as possible: Store all extra JSONs (chrome trace categories, console log and more), and the screenshots between runs (before they where stored on exit). This is good because it will decrease the memory impact but it is non backward compatible change! Sitespeed.io and other tools need to change how they handle extra JSONs and the screenshot. Browsertime users that uses browsertime from the command line will not see any change. We also moved most stats to be collected between runs, that is needed for CPU stats since we store the data and throws it away between runs [#449](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/449).
* We disabled the old HAR Export trigger (max Firefox 54). And we now uses the new [https://github.com/devtools-html/har-export-trigger/](https://github.com/devtools-html/har-export-trigger/) that needs Firefox 60 or later to work.
* We renamed the options to get Visual Metrics to be ```--visualMetrics``` instead of --speedIndex. When we first introduced Visual Metrics Speed Index was more known, but it has always been a thorn in the side to call the option that. In Docker we collect Visual Metrics by default.
* We use [sharp](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) to store/convert screenshots. Screenshots are now located in the screenshots folder, named after each run. Default are now jpg screenshots. [#468](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/468). Checkout all the new ```--screenshotParams``` configurations.
* Remove deprecated (renamed) options experimental.dumpChromePerflog (use chrome.collectPerfLog) and chrome.dumpTraceCategoriesLog (use chrome.collectTracingEvents).
* Remove broken support for video recording on macOS (Docker on mac still works).
* Removed deprecated (renamed) option videoRaw. Always use ```--videoParams.addTimer``` (boolean) if you want to toggle timer/metrics in the video
* We now use pageLoadStrategy "none". That means if you run your own pageCompleteCheck you can now end your test whenever you want (before onLoad if you want) [#501](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/501).
* We changed how we change between orange to white when we record a video. Depending on your machine, Selenium/WebDriver introduced latency the old way we did the switch [#503](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/503).
* We removed collecting Resource Timing data as default [#505](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/505). If you still need the metrics, you can still run the script: [https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/2.x/browserscripts/timings/resourceTimings.js](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/2.x/browserscripts/timings/resourceTimings.js).
* You can now choose what kind of response bodies you want to store in your HAR file . Instead of using ```--firefox.includeResponseBodies``` to include all bodies you can now use ```--firefox.includeResponseBodies``` [none,all,html] [#518](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/518).
* We cleaned up how you collect trace logs from Chrome. If you want the devtools.timeline log (and CPU spent metrics), just use ```--chrome.timeline```. If you want to configure trace categories yourself, use ```--chrome.traceCategories```
* File names are now based on 1 and not 0 so the first file from the first iteration is named something with -1. [#536](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/536).

## version 2.5.0 2018-04-07
### Fixed
* We rollbacked the HAR exporter to the one that works in FF 54 and will wait on FF 61 until we update. That means that the 
2.x branch and releases will stay locked to FF54 in the Docker file while we are working in Browsertime 3.0. The current way of 
using the new HAR exporter adds about 1 second overhead on our test pages on dasgboard.sitespeed.io.

* Upgraded Chrome-HAR with fixes for Chrome 66 and when network error happans.

## version 2.4.1 2018-04-05
### Fixed
* User Timing measurements was handled incorrect so they was never sent correctly to Graphite. Thanks [@knaos](https://github.com/knaos) for reporting and finding the issue.
* Firefox 60 vs 61 has changed what is returned by the HAR export trigger. We now handles both.

## version 2.4.0 2018-03-20
### Fixed 
* Reverting fix for Chrome 65 disabling infobars. We use Chrome 66 now.
### Added
* Updated Docker to use Chrome 66 beta and FF 61 Nightly

## version 2.3.0 2018-03-16

### Added
* Updated to the new HAR Export plugin for Firefox, needs Firefox 60 to work (beta/nightly)
* Updated Docker container to use Chrome 65 and Firefox 60 (currently nightly, soon beta)
* If you run in verbose mode and the run fails, Browsertime will try to take a screenshot of the screen to make it esier to understand why it fails. Thanks [Vitaliy Honcharenko](https://github.com/vgoncharenko) for the PR! [#508](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/508).

### Fixed

* Fixed better way to end the tests when running WebPageReplay [#460](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/460).
* Do not try to replay if recording fails for WebPageReplay
* Default wait time is loadEventEnd + 5 s (before 2s) for WebPageReplay
* If recording or accessing the URL fails then do to replay for WebPageReplay
* Handle filenames with % for FFMPEG https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1911
* Updated to Chromedriver 2.36
* Updated to Geckodriver 0.20.0
* Updated to Chrome-har 0.3.0
* Added offset for video in Chrome 65 (that broken infobar) [#489](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/489).
* Turn off OCSP request for Firefox when running WebPageReplay
* Parse --firefox.preferences values as Numbers if they are a number :)

## version 2.2.2 2018-02-22

### Fixed

* New version of the trace parser (for CPU metrics) with updated feature list.
* New updated Browsertime extension adding support for web sockets.

## version 2.2.1 2018-02-14

### Fixed

* Return missing promises when getting the console log.
* Use pre compiled version of WebPageReplay to minimise the size of the Docker container [#443](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/443).

## version 2.2.0 2018-02-14

### Added

* You can now get more meaningful CPU metrics out of Chrome (both by category and per event type). Use it by adding --chrome.traceCategories devtools.timeline --chrome.collectTracingEvents --chrome.collectCPUMetrics. [#434](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/434). We use [https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/trace-parser](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/trace-parser) to parse the Chrome trace log.

* You can now get the Chrome console log by --chrome.collectConsoleLog. It will be written to disk (one file per run) [#345](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/345).

### Fixed

* We increased the probesize again for FFMPEG [#441](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/441), maybe it can help people running without setting connectivity and have video problems.

* Another go at fixing so that Chromedriver doesn't hang (sometimes) following https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/87 [#442](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/442) in the Docker container.

## version 2.1.7 2018-01-25

### Fixed

* The start script in the Docker file handled parameters wrong. [#430](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/430).

* Updated to Chrome 64 in the WebPageReplay Docker container.

## version 2.1.6 2018-01-24

### Fixed

* Another WebPageReplay bug: Setting correct ports for WebPageReplaying

## version 2.1.5 2018-01-24

### Fixed

* Replaying and ADB failed in the WebPageReplay Docker container (always trying to reply).

## version 2.1.4 2018-01-23

### Fixed

* You can now run WebPageReplay in the Docker container together with your Android phone.

* The WPR Docker is updated with Firefox 58.

* Updated to Chromedriver 2.35.0

## version 2.1.3 2018-01-10

### Fixed

* Removed chrome.loadTimes that will be deprecated in Chrome 64 [#417](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/417). Instead use the paint timing API.

* We had introduced a problem with getting the trace log from Chrome that could make getting the log tiemout see [#420](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/420), the original issue is a bug in Chromedriver 2.29+ see [#337](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/337)

## version 2.1.2 2017-12-18

### Fixed

* Trap WebPageReplay so you can stop running it the command line (WebPageReplay Docker container).
* Updated to Chromedriver 2.34

## version 2.1.1 2017-12-13

### Fixed

* The new experimental alpha Docker container including WebPageReplay, wasn't working completely, updated version https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime#using-webpagereplay

## version 2.1.0 2017-12-12

### Added

* Upgrade to Chrome 63 in the default Dockerfile
* There's a new experimental Docker container including WebPageReplay, it's kind of a alpha feature and you can test it out if you want: https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime#using-webpagereplay

## version 2.0.1 2017-11-28

### Fixed

* Some Android phones video didn't work as we expected, having different values when analyzing the white background [#408](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/408).

* Instead of hardcoded path to the sdcard for Android, we now fetch it dynamically [#409](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/409).

### Internally

* We have started using await/async!

## version 2.0.0 2017-11-23

## IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE

* We now use latest NodeJS 8.9, so you need to upgrade
* The default framerate for video is now 30, before it was 60. If you want to keep using 60, add `--videoParams.framerate 60`
* The default engine when you run in Docker is now "external" instead of tc, that means if you want to change the connectivity you need to do that with Docker networks or use the bundled Throttle engine. We also removed TSProxy and tc. Please use Docker networks or Throttle as engine.

### Added

* Recording videos is now done in two steps: First record as lossless as possible and then convert to a viewable format [#378](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/378).
* Upgraded to Selenium 3.6 [#380](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/380).
* You can now turn on/off the filmstrip screenshots (`--videoParams.createFilmstrip`), set the quality (`--videoParams.filmstripQuality`), and choose if you want them in full video size (`--videoParams.filmstripFullSize`) [#385](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/385).
* It is now easy to run Firefox Nightly, Beta and Developer edition on Mac OS X. Just add `--firefox.nightly`, `--firefox.beta` or `--firefox.developer` to the cli (for Linux you need point out the location with `--firefox.binaryPath` [#384](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/384)
* You can now configure which display number xvfb will use (default 99) [#389](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/389).
* Automatically collect video and visual metrics in Docker.
* Setting default values for video parameters, making it easier to run Browsertime in NodeJS [#394](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/394).
* Added configurable wait time (`--videoParams.androidVideoWaitTime` default is 5000 ms) for pulling the video from mobile to the server [#393](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/393).
* You can now run Firefox against insecure certs `--firefox.acceptInsecureCerts` [#399](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/399)
* Added TimeToNonBlank for Firefox.
* You can now create a video that includes what you run in preScript and postScript by `--videoParams.combine`
* Adding package-lock.json via node 8 for consistent dependency install

### Removed/changed

* We removed TSProxy and tc (sltc) as connectivity engines since none of them worked 100%. Instead user Docker networks or the new Throttle engine [#379](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/379/). The default engine when you run in Docker is now external, before it was tc.

* The default framerate for video is now 30 (before 60). See `--videoParams.framerate`. We have done a lot of testing on C4.large on AWS and 60 fps adds too much overhead that makes metrics unstable.

* We upgraded to use NodeJS 8 and you should do that too.

### Fixed

* Always run the extension first, then prescripts [#395](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/395).
* Tighten Firefox settings (calling home etc).
* Escape path names with = sign for FFProbe.

## version 1.9.5 2017-10-14

### Fixed

* Updated to Throttle 0.1.0 that fixes a bug so we get a promise when we set connectivity on localhost on Linux and always remove filters before setting new ones. Throttle is now more robust.

## version 1.9.4 2017-10-04

### Fixed

* Updated version of throttle that sets the correct delay on localhost (before the delay was \*2).
* Upgraded to Chromedriver 2.33.0 that fixes running Chrome > 61

## version 1.9.3 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Updated version of throttle so that route runs with sudo.
* Removed the check for custom connectivity so you ca set just latency if that's what you want.

## version 1.9.2 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Larger default bottom margin when calculating Visual Metrics [#375](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/375).

## version 1.9.1 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Fixed log check for missmatch between iterations and created pages.
* Upgaded Throttle with a bug fix so that the ingress filter is removed in Linux.

## version 1.9.0 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Let VisualMetrics use the same bottom margin as WebaPageTest.
* Use Chromedriver 2.32.0
* Silence XVFB by default. Add -vv (or higher) to let XVFB send to default stderr.

### Added

* New way to throttle your connection using Throttle: https://github.com/sitespeedio/throttle - still very early release, test at your own risk :)

## version 1.8.2 2017-09-17

### Fixed

* Always (yes always) use no-sandbox for Chrome when running in Docker.

## version 1.8.1 2017-09-16

### Fixed

* Even bigger bottom margin (20px) for videos to make emulated mobile lastVisualChange correct.

## version 1.8.0 2017-09-13

* Upgraded sltc so we use 0.6.0 with simplified tc that actually works
* We now run xvfb from inside NodeJS so we can set the screen size, making it easy to record the correct size for VisualMetrics. We also use environment variables that starts with BROWSERTIME so we can turn on xvfb easily on Docker.

* This is the first beta of 1.0. 1.0 is a TOTAL rewrite from 0.12.3. We don't use BrowserMobProxy anymore (so you don't need Java). To get the HAR from Firefox we use the [HAR Export Trigger](https://github.com/firebug/har-export-trigger) and Chrome we parse the timeline log and generates the HAR file.

* The beta-1 has no way of blocking requests, if you need that functionality you should wait with upgrading.

## version 0.12.3

* Navigation Timings are now included in the statistics so you can get median times for all Navigation Timing metrics.

## version 0.9.8

* Upgrading Selenium version to 2.46.1 that makes it work on Windows (again).

## version 0.9.7

* Upgrading selenium version to 2.46.0 that will make Firefox (38) useable again.

* Fixed incorrect HAR files generated by version 0.9.0 (page title was missing).
* Renaming resourceTiming to resourceTimings to follow our pattern.

## version 0.9.0

* New data structure in the output JSON, better support for custom Metrics. Note if you fetch values from the JSON, you will need to change how you do it.
* Latest Selenium supports IE and Safari without the Selenium jar, use it! Safari users, install SafariDriver.safariextz from http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.45/
* Safari doesn't support pageLoadTimeout, disable for Safari
* Cleaned up the use of javascript that runs in the browser: get name from the filename and keep scripts simple. #77

  one of the problems is Selenium/Chromedriver, we will try to fix the main issue but for now we will exit
  the process #74

## version 0.8.22

* You can now choose to supply a Javascript that will decide when a run is finished. The default
  script is 'return window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd>0'. Use the parameter --waitScript

* The browsermob prixy will now test a port and use it if it's free. Before the port was hardcoded.

## version 0.8.21

  users of the command line tool, only programmers embedding the browsertime jar in other tools.
* Added ignore zoom settings for Internet Explorer and type for msFirstPaint
* Include browserTimeVersion entry in static page data.

## version 0.4 (2013-11-15)

* User Timing marks and measures should now be compatible with Firefox 25. Custom user marks are also converted to
  "synthetic" measures, with duration as time from the navigationStart event. This way user marks are also
  included in statistics.

## version 0.3 (2013-11-09)

* Added frontEndTime (responseEnd & loadEventStart) & backEndTime (navigationStart, responseStart) measurements to make it cleaner when comparing.
* Collect page data (browser version etc.) on first timing run. This reduces the number of times the browser is
  launched, making Browsertime run faster.
* Added -t option to set timeout value when loading urls (default remains 60 seconds).
* Created packages as zip and tar.gz that includes a shell script to run Browsertime, all jars, README, and CHANGELOG.

## version 0.2 (2013-11-05)

* Add --raw flag to control if data for individual runs is included in output.
  The default is to not include run data. NOTE - this is a change in the default
  output from 0.1.
* Add optional --compact flag to disable pretty printing of xml and json.
* Update format of xml/json (NOTE - incompatible changes from 0.1)

- all metrics and statistics are now floating point numbers
- numbers in json output are now represented as strings (surrounded by quotes). This is an
  unfortunate side-effect of avoiding printing numbers in scientific notation.
- time property of marks and measurements have been renamed startTime
- measurements and statistics are now sorted according to start time.

* Changed max wait time for the Selenium driver from 30 s to 60 s
* Updated org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java from 2.35.0 to 2.37.1
* Fix for Firefox 25 that added toJson in window.performance.timings

## version 0.1 (2013-10-07)

* First release
