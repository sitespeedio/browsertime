# Browsertime changelog

## UNRELEASED UPCOMING 3.0

### Fixed

* New version of the trace parser (for CPU metrics) with updated feature list.
* Move video out of pre/post scripts. When we first started with the video we used the pre/post structure. That was ok to move fast but one of the negatives is that stopping the video happen after we collected all metrics. We now stop the video exactly when the the page is finished loading [#448](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/448).
* In the browsretime.json mdev was never formatted, now we use 4 decimals (make the JSON more readable) [#453](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/453).
* Modernized the JavaScript we use to collect the metrics, see [#457](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/457).

### Added

* You can now turn on the MOZ HTTP log for Firefox with --firefox.collectMozLog [#451](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/451) see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Debugging/HTTP_logging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Debugging/HTTP_logging)

* Upgraded to new Browsertime extension with support for web sockets see https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime-extension/issues/5

### Changed

* Store the Chromedriver log in the result directory (before it was stored where you run Browsertime) [#452](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/452).

* Metrics like first paint, resource timings and paint timings was reported with 8 decimals in worst cases. Reporting in full ms is ok [#455](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/455).

### BREAKING CHANGE

* Store extra JSON and screenshots per run (and collect stats between runs). We want to make Browsertime as mean and clean as possible: Store all extra JSONs (chrome trace categories, console log and more), and the screenshots between runs (before they where stored on exit). This is good because it will decrease the memory impact but it is non backward compatible change! Sitespeed.io and other tools need to change how they handle extra JSONs and the screenshot. Browsertime users that uses browsertime from the command line will not see any change. We also moved most stats to be collected between runs, that is needed for CPU stats since we store the data and throws it away between runs [#449](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/449).

* We disabled getting a HAR for Firefox to be able to upgrade from Firefox 54 to Firefox 58 [#467](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/467). We wait for [https://github.com/devtools-html/har-export-trigger/](https://github.com/devtools-html/har-export-trigger/) to be fully functional to enable HARs again for Firefox.

* We use [sharp](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) to store/convert screenshots. Screenshots are now located in the screenshots folder, named after each run. Default are now jpg screenshots. [#468](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/468).
* Remove deprecated (renamed) options experimental.dumpChromePerflog (use chrome.collectPerfLog) and chrome.dumpTraceCategoriesLog (use chrome.collectTracingEvents).
* Remove broken support for video recording on macOS (Docker on mac still works).

## version 2.2.2 2018-02-22

### Fixed

* New version of the trace parser (for CPU metrics) with updated feature list.
* New updated Browsertime extension adding support for web sockets.

## version 2.2.1 2018-02-14

### Fixed

* Return missing promises when getting the console log.
* Use pre compiled version of WebPageReplay to minimise the size of the Docker container [#443](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/443).

## version 2.2.0 2018-02-14

### Added

* You can now get more meaningful CPU metrics out of Chrome (both by category and per event type). Use it by adding --chrome.traceCategories devtools.timeline --chrome.collectTracingEvents --chrome.collectCPUMetrics. [#434](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/434). We use [https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/trace-parser](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/trace-parser) to parse the Chrome trace log.

* You can now get the Chrome console log by --chrome.collectConsoleLog. It will be written to disk (one file per run) [#345](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/345).

### Fixed

* We increased the probesize again for FFMPEG [#441](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/441), maybe it can help people running without setting connectivity and have video problems.

* Another go at fixing so that Chromedriver doesn't hang (sometimes) following https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/87 [#442](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/442) in the Docker container.

## version 2.1.7 2018-01-25

### Fixed

* The start script in the Docker file handled parameters wrong. [#430](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/430).

* Updated to Chrome 64 in the WebPageReplay Docker container.

## version 2.1.6 2018-01-24

### Fixed

* Another WebPageReplay bug: Setting correct ports for WebPageReplaying

## version 2.1.5 2018-01-24

### Fixed

* Replaying and ADB failed in the WebPageReplay Docker container (always trying to reply).

## version 2.1.4 2018-01-23

### Fixed

* You can now run WebPageReplay in the Docker container together with your Android phone.

* The WPR Docker is updated with Firefox 58.

* Updated to Chromedriver 2.35.0

## version 2.1.3 2018-01-10

### Fixed

* Removed chrome.loadTimes that will be deprecated in Chrome 64 [#417](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/417). Instead use the paint timing API.

* We had introduced a problem with getting the trace log from Chrome that could make getting the log tiemout see [#420](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/420), the original issue is a bug in Chromedriver 2.29+ see [#337](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/337)

## version 2.1.2 2017-12-18

### Fixed

* Trap WebPageReplay so you can stop running it the command line (WebPageReplay Docker container).
* Updated to Chromedriver 2.34

## version 2.1.1 2017-12-13

### Fixed

* The new experimental alpha Docker container including WebPageReplay, wasn't working completely, updated version https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime#using-webpagereplay

## version 2.1.0 2017-12-12

### Added

* Upgrade to Chrome 63 in the default Dockerfile
* There's a new experimental Docker container including WebPageReplay, it's kind of a alpha feature and you can test it out if you want: https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime#using-webpagereplay

## version 2.0.1 2017-11-28

### Fixed

* Some Android phones video didn't work as we expected, having different values when analyzing the white background [#408](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/408).

* Instead of hardcoded path to the sdcard for Android, we now fetch it dynamically [#409](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/409).

### Internally

* We have started using await/async!

## version 2.0.0 2017-11-23

## IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE

* We now use latest NodeJS 8.9, so you need to upgrade
* The default framerate for video is now 30, before it was 60. If you want to keep using 60, add `--videoParams.framerate 60`
* The default engine when you run in Docker is now "external" instead of tc, that means if you want to change the connectivity you need to do that with Docker networks or use the bundled Throttle engine. We also removed TSProxy and tc. Please use Docker networks or Throttle as engine.

### Added

* Recording videos is now done in two steps: First record as lossless as possible and then convert to a viewable format [#378](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/378).
* Upgraded to Selenium 3.6 [#380](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/380).
* You can now turn on/off the filmstrip screenshots (`--videoParams.createFilmstrip`), set the quality (`--videoParams.filmstripQuality`), and choose if you want them in full video size (`--videoParams.filmstripFullSize`) [#385](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/385).
* It is now easy to run Firefox Nightly, Beta and Developer edition on Mac OS X. Just add `--firefox.nightly`, `--firefox.beta` or `--firefox.developer` to the cli (for Linux you need point out the location with `--firefox.binaryPath` [#384](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/384)
* You can now configure which display number xvfb will use (default 99) [#389](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/389).
* Automatically collect video and visual metrics in Docker.
* Setting default values for video parameters, making it easier to run Browsertime in NodeJS [#394](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/394).
* Added configurable wait time (`--videoParams.androidVideoWaitTime` default is 5000 ms) for pulling the video from mobile to the server [#393](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/393).
* You can now run Firefox against insecure certs `--firefox.acceptInsecureCerts` [#399](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/399)
* Added TimeToNonBlank for Firefox.
* You can now create a video that includes what you run in preScript and postScript by `--videoParams.combine`
* Adding package-lock.json via node 8 for consistent dependency install

### Removed/changed

* We removed TSProxy and tc (sltc) as connectivity engines since none of them worked 100%. Instead user Docker networks or the new Throttle engine [#379](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/379/). The default engine when you run in Docker is now external, before it was tc.

* The default framerate for video is now 30 (before 60). See `--videoParams.framerate`. We have done a lot of testing on C4.large on AWS and 60 fps adds too much overhead that makes metrics unstable.

* We upgraded to use NodeJS 8 and you should do that too.

### Fixed

* Always run the extension first, then prescripts [#395](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/395).
* Tighten Firefox settings (calling home etc).
* Escape path names with = sign for FFProbe.

## version 1.9.5 2017-10-14

### Fixed

* Updated to Throttle 0.1.0 that fixes a bug so we get a promise when we set connectivity on localhost on Linux and always remove filters before setting new ones. Throttle is now more robust.

## version 1.9.4 2017-10-04

### Fixed

* Updated version of throttle that sets the correct delay on localhost (before the delay was \*2).
* Upgraded to Chromedriver 2.33.0 that fixes running Chrome > 61

## version 1.9.3 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Updated version of throttle so that route runs with sudo.
* Removed the check for custom connectivity so you ca set just latency if that's what you want.

## version 1.9.2 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Larger default bottom margin when calculating Visual Metrics [#375](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/375).

## version 1.9.1 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Fixed log check for missmatch between iterations and created pages.
* Upgaded Throttle with a bug fix so that the ingress filter is removed in Linux.

## version 1.9.0 2017-09-29

### Fixed

* Let VisualMetrics use the same bottom margin as WebaPageTest.
* Use Chromedriver 2.32.0
* Silence XVFB by default. Add -vv (or higher) to let XVFB send to default stderr.

### Added

* New way to throttle your connection using Throttle: https://github.com/sitespeedio/throttle - still very early release, test at your own risk :)

## version 1.8.0 2017-09-13

### Added

* Easy to run Firefox Nightly, just pass --firefox.nightly (and -b firefox)
* Support for running Firefox and Chrome in headless mode --headless. You need Firefox Nightly or Chrome stable [#361](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/361)
* Upgraded to Chrome 61 in the Dockerfile
* You can now change the framerate of the video with --videoParams.framerate
* You can also change the constant rate factor of the video --videoParams.crf see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264#crf
* Added visualComplete95 and visualComplete99 metrics.

### Changed

* Old parameter videoRaw is renamed to --videoParams.addTimer to toogle timer/text in the video (old videoRaw is deprecated but still works).

### Fixed

* Changed Docker workdir so it is possible to use pre/post script in Docker. This means you need to map your volume as "$(pwd)":/browsertime [#363](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/363)

* Changed the bottom margin for videos (made it a little larger) to fix lastVisualChange when emulating mobile [sitespeed.io #1690](https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1690)

## version 1.7.0 2017-08-29

### Added

* Set your own alias for connectivity https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/222
* Remove the orange color from the video (that makes us sync start) and added optional timer and metrics in the HTML
* You can now choose if you want to have a video: --video and --speedIndex
* Use --preURL to hit a URL before you access the URL you wanna analyze
* We use connectivity engine tc by default in Docker.

### Fixed

* The final mp4 is now compatible with all modern browsers, thank you [Walter Ebert](https://github.com/walterebert) for the help!
* Local cache HAR entries in Firefox is removed https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/pull/227
* Beta.12 broke android testing by setting viewport, fixed for next release.
* Chrome now always start inside of Docker, we finally got rid of the Chrome doesn't start in time problem https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/87#issuecomment-250475864

## version 1.0-beta.12 2016-11-20

### Added

* Add a alias/custom name to your connectivity profile. Thank you @jpvincent for the idea! https://github.com/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/issues/1329
* Cli option to remove the created video (record the video to get SpeedIndex and then remove the video).
* Video is now mp4.

### Fixed

* Better exit handling when killing FFMpeg , overall code cleanup for ffmpeg/video
* Introduced small wait time before record video that makes the connection problem for 3g using tc go away (hopefully).

### Changed

## version 1.0-beta.11 2016-11-13

### Fixed

* Disabled infobars in Chrome (they messed up start render and SpeedIndex).

## version 1.0-beta.10 2016-11-11

### Added

* Added initiator of each request entry to chrome HAR
* Output SpeedIndex & firstVisualChange in the logs if you use VisualMetrics

### Fixed

* Generating HAR files from Chrome caused a crash in some cases. (#209)
* Entry timings in HAR files from Chrome were strings instead of numbers.
* One extra fix for outputing timing metrics in the console: If timing metrics is < 1000 ms don't convert to seconds and let always have fixed\
  size for mdev fixing many numbers for SpeedIndex.

### Changed

* Configure proxies with --proxy.http and --proxy.https
* New TSProxy that is less complex
* Upgraded Selenium to 3.0.1 (no beta!)
* Upgraded Geckodriver to 0.11.1
* Updated minimum NodeJS to 6.9.0 (same as Selenium). IMPORTANT: Selenium 3.0.0 will not work on NodeJS 4.x so you need to update.
* Export chrome perflog dumps as json in extraJson property of the result, instead of a string in the extras property. Only relevant to api users.
* Upgraded sltc so we use 0.6.0 with simplified tc that actually works
* We now run xvfb from inside NodeJS so we can set the screen size, making it easy to record the correct size for VisualMetrics. We also use environment variables that starts with BROWSERTIME so we can turn on xvfb easily on Docker.

## version 1.0-beta.9 2016-10-16

### Fixed

* Set default device to eth0 when running tc (without using the CLI).

## version 1.0-beta.8 2016-10-16

* Increased the default script timeout from 40 s to 80 s.
* Log script name if a script fails to make it easier to find failing scripts.
* Renamed the browserscripts/timings/timings.js → browserscripts/timings/pageTimings.js

## version 1.0-beta.1

* This is the first beta of 1.0. 1.0 is a TOTAL rewrite from 0.12.3. We don't use BrowserMobProxy anymore (so you don't need Java). To get the HAR from Firefox we use the [HAR Export Trigger](https://github.com/firebug/har-export-trigger) and Chrome we parse the timeline log and generates the HAR file.

* The beta-1 has no way of blocking requests, if you need that functionality you should wait with upgrading.

## version 0.12.3

* Upgraded Selenium to work with Firefox 47.0.1

## version 0.12.2

* Add ability to block urls (e.g. return 404) based on regex.

## version 0.12.1

* Fix parsing of --headers and --connectionRaw options. Note that JSON strings needs to be properly quoted when
  passed on the command line, e.g. --headers '{"name":"value"}'

## version 0.12.0

* Upgrade selenium-webdriver to 2.47. This means dropping node 0.10 support, but allowing installation on node 4.x.

## version 0.11.0

* Don't log 'Storing ...har' when har generation is turned off.
* Handle cases where HAR file from MobProxy is lacking log.browser without crashing.
* Set correct Browsertime version in HAR file (previously was always 1.0)
* Remove --useProxy option and replace with a --noProxy flag. Please update your scripts if you use this

## version 0.10.2

* Bug fix: Running multiple tests, included same requests many many times in one HAR #91

## version 0.10.1

* Bug fix: Show correct browser and version in the HAR file #90

## version 0.10.0

* Remove level prefix (e.g. info: ) from console log lines. Log files aren't affected.
* Normalized Navigation Timing Data: All navigation timing metrics are now relative from Navigation start instead of using timestamps #88
* Navigation Timings are now included in the statistics so you can get median times for all Navigation Timing metrics.

## version 0.9.8

* Upgrading Selenium version to 2.46.1 that makes it work on Windows (again).

## version 0.9.7

* Upgrading selenium version to 2.46.0 that will make Firefox (38) useable again.

## version 0.9.6

* Increased timeouts to be 2 minutes instead of 1 minute. Running using mobile2g times out a lot.

## version 0.9.5

* Added more default connection types: mobile2g and mobile3gslow
* Ability to avoid sandbox mode when runnig Chrome (use with care)

## version 0.9.4

* Possible to configure a selenium server (hopefully make IE run smoother on Windows and
  Chrome on Linux).

## version 0.9.3

* User timing marks was missing from statistics since 0.9. This puts then back!
* Timeout a run if it takes too long. On Linux Chrome/Chromedriver can hang, making Browsertime hang. This fix kill the chromedriver and signal an error if it happens.

## version 0.9.2

* Fixed installation issue on npm v0.12.0, Windows 7 (thanks Patrick Wieczorek)
* Hello HTTPS! We now proxy HTTPS traffic making HAR Files containing HTTPS requests.
* Internet Explorer: Clean session between runs, ignore zoom settings and set proxy per process
* Internal: Killing Chromedriver on Linux if it is up and running after a finished round. Need to be run after each URL when we have a working timeout for Chrome.

## version 0.9.1

* Fixed incorrect HAR files generated by version 0.9.0 (page title was missing).
* Renaming resourceTiming to resourceTimings to follow our pattern.

## version 0.9.0

* New data structure in the output JSON, better support for custom Metrics. Note if you fetch values from the JSON, you will need to change how you do it.
* Latest Selenium supports IE and Safari without the Selenium jar, use it! Safari users, install SafariDriver.safariextz from http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.45/
* Safari doesn't support pageLoadTimeout, disable for Safari
* Cleaned up the use of javascript that runs in the browser: get name from the filename and keep scripts simple. #77
* Running Browsertime on node.js version 0.8 is no longer supported (or tested).
* Fix incorrect calculation of serverConnectionTime in json output.
* Removed toJSON method from Resource Timing data from Firefox
* Getting window size from the actual window.
* Internally: Get metrics and static values from the browser using JS.
* Set the page title in the HAR
* Added more timings per page, follow WPT style in the HAR
* Changed name of parameter scriptPath to customScripts to better match what it does
* Locking versions in package.json to be SAFE

## version 0.8.26

* Update to Selenium 2.45.1 to get latest bug fixes.
* Avoid hangs when fetching urls by explicitly set timeout values in Selenium drivers.

## version 0.8.25

* New Selenium version (2.45) to support Firefox 36

## version 0.8.24

* Fix that kills the BMP on Windows (using taskkill)

## version 0.8.23

* Log to standard log when uncaught exception happens, so that it will be propagated to sitespeed.io
* So we have a real proble with processes that just hangs, it happens on when we get an uncaught exception,
  one of the problems is Selenium/Chromedriver, we will try to fix the main issue but for now we will exit
  the process #74

## version 0.8.22

* You can now choose to supply a Javascript that will decide when a run is finished. The default
  script is 'return window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd>0'. Use the parameter --waitScript

* The browsermob prixy will now test a port and use it if it's free. Before the port was hardcoded.

## version 0.8.21

* Upgraded to the new BrowserMobProxy 2.0.0

## version 0.8

* Ooops, what happend? the new version is written in NodeJS, instead of Java.
* Check out the README or --help to see new input format.
* You can now run your own javascript in the browser and get the data back in the JSON.
* Support for getting timings using PhantomJS 2.
* Limit the connection speed.

## version 0.7

* Add support for sending BASIC AUTH credentials, by specifying the --basic-auth option.
* Add support for generating har files, by specifying the --har-file option.
* Add support for sending request headers by specifying the --headers option.
* Bugfix: Set right values for serverResponseTime
* Upgrade Selenium to version 2.41.

## version 0.6 (2014-02-05)

* Fix crash while trying to run resource timing measurements in Firefox.
* Provide better error messages if chromedriver, IEDriverServer or Firefox is missing.
* Upgraded to latest version of Selenium, for (hopefully) increased stability in the interaction with browsers.
* Suppress chromedriver diagnostics output (Starting ChromeDriver...) when running Chrome
* Add --verbose and --debug option for getting additional information printed as Browsertime runs.

## version 0.5 (2014-01-09)

* Windows support - Browsertime now ships with a bat file, and Internet Explorer has been confirmed to work.
* Collect resource timing metrics (http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/), included when outputting all metrics using
  the --raw option.
* Add support for specifying http proxy, using a new --proxyHost option.
* Updated maven groupId and Java package name to use net.browsertime instead of com.soulgalore. This does not affect
  users of the command line tool, only programmers embedding the browsertime jar in other tools.
* Added ignore zoom settings for Internet Explorer and type for msFirstPaint
* Include browserTimeVersion entry in static page data.

## version 0.4 (2013-11-15)

* User Timing marks and measures should now be compatible with Firefox 25. Custom user marks are also converted to
  "synthetic" measures, with duration as time from the navigationStart event. This way user marks are also
  included in statistics.

## version 0.3 (2013-11-09)

* Added frontEndTime (responseEnd & loadEventStart) & backEndTime (navigationStart, responseStart) measurements to make it cleaner when comparing.
* Collect page data (browser version etc.) on first timing run. This reduces the number of times the browser is
  launched, making Browsertime run faster.
* Added -t option to set timeout value when loading urls (default remains 60 seconds).
* Created packages as zip and tar.gz that includes a shell script to run Browsertime, all jars, README, and CHANGELOG.

## version 0.2 (2013-11-05)

* Add --raw flag to control if data for individual runs is included in output.
  The default is to not include run data. NOTE - this is a change in the default
  output from 0.1.
* Add optional --compact flag to disable pretty printing of xml and json.
* Update format of xml/json (NOTE - incompatible changes from 0.1)

- all metrics and statistics are now floating point numbers
- numbers in json output are now represented as strings (surrounded by quotes). This is an
  unfortunate side-effect of avoiding printing numbers in scientific notation.
- time property of marks and measurements have been renamed startTime
- measurements and statistics are now sorted according to start time.

* Changed max wait time for the Selenium driver from 30 s to 60 s
* Updated org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java from 2.35.0 to 2.37.1
* Fix for Firefox 25 that added toJson in window.performance.timings

## version 0.1 (2013-10-07)

* First release
