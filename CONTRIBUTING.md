# How to contribute
Browser Time (it's browser time!) needs help from the users so please contribute!

## Making changes
If you want help out, that's great! Check the issue list and see if there's something there you want to do and drop Tobias or Peter a note so we know and we can help you get into the project.
 - Create a new branch for your change
 - Make commits of logical units and write an informative message
 - Make sure you have added the tests needed for your change
 - Run all the tests to make sure you haven't broken anything else (it happens to the best!)

## Add a defect
First, check the defect/bug list https://github.com/tobli/browsertime/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open to make sure that it hasn't been filed yet.

If you find a defect, please file a bug report. Include the following:
 - Explain the bug/defect and what you where doing
 - OS, browser  & versions
 - Always add the URL of the page you where testing (if it is secret, drop me an email peter**at**soulgalore.com and send me the address) 

If you have the skills & the time, it is perfect if you send a pull request with a fix, that helps me alot!

## Add a change request/new functionality request
If you have an idea or something that you want Browser Time to handle, add an issue and lets discuss it there. Ideas/changes/requests are very very welcome!


Thanks for your support & time!

Tobias & Peter
