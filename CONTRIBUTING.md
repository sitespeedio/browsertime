# How to contribute
Browser Time (it's browser time!) needs help from the users so please contribute!

## Making changes
If you want help out, that's great! Check the issue list and see if there's something there you want to do and drop Peter a note so we know and we can help you get into the project.
 - Create a new branch for your change
 - Make commits of logical units and write an informative message
 - Make sure you have added the tests needed for your change
 - Run all the tests to make sure you haven't broken anything else (it happens to the best!)

## Add a defect
First, check the defect/bug list https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug to make sure that it hasn't been filed yet.

If you find a defect, please file a bug report and follow the instructions in https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/bug-report/

If you have the skills & the time, it is perfect if you send a pull request with a fix, that helps me alot!

## Add a change request/new functionality request
